# Pan-Card-Fraud-Detection-with-Two-Level-Authentication
This project proposes a two-level authentication system for identity verification. The first level involves using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to compare features and identify individuals. The second level utilizes Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract the PAN Card number from the PAN Card and match it with a database.
